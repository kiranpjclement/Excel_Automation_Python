# Excel_Automation_Python
Excel_Automation_with_Pyxl
This is a self driven project for my repetative Monday Excel activities.
The whole Process takes more than 6 hours to complete every Monday.
By automating this reduce the time within 10 min with 100% accuracy.
Since the organization data is confidential , I created a dummy  data similar to the one we have.
And created pyxl functions to automate the process.
This project is completly done in my Personal machine and created a automation Video and submitted to HOD to get an apporval to develope the same inhouse with original data
